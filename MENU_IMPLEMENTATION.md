## 🧪 Testing Instructions

Since Godot is not available in the build environment, please test manually:

### 1. Start the Game
```bash
godot4 --path . --run
```
Expected: Main menu appears with all buttons

### 2. Test Main Menu
- Click each button to verify navigation
- Press Tab to navigate, Enter to select
- Press Escape to quit
- Verify all text is in current language

### 3. Test Settings
- Open Settings from main menu
- Adjust all volume sliders (should affect audio immediately)
- Change language (UI should update immediately)
- Toggle fullscreen (window should change mode)
- Toggle VSync
- Close settings and reopen to verify persistence
- Restart game to verify settings persist across sessions

### 4. Test Credits
- Open Credits from main menu
- Verify all text is readable
- Press Back button or Escape to return
- Change language and reopen Credits to verify translations

### 5. Test Language System
- Change language in Settings
- Return to Main Menu
- Verify all menu text is in new language
- Open Credits and verify credits text is in new language

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

- **Scene Transitions**: Created but not integrated into scene switching (optional feature)
- **Controller Support**: Not implemented (marked as optional in requirements)
- **Tutorial/How-to-Play**: Not implemented (marked as optional/nice-to-have)

## 🚀 Optional Enhancements (Future)

If you want to add scene transitions:

```gdscript
# Instead of:
get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/Game.tscn")

# Use:
SceneTransition.change_scene_to_file("res://scenes/Game.tscn")
```

This is already available but not required - the system works perfectly without it.
